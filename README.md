# go-quill-chroma-renderer

Golang based [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) renderer for QuillJS Delta format. It has a chroma compatible formatter, as well as a custom function that emits Delta data structure directly. Both generate Delta changes that apply syntax highlighting to the original text.
